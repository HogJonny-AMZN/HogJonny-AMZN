- âš¡ Fun fact: I wrote a game-like PBR material for the Maya Viewport: [GitHub - hogjonny/Maya-PBR-BRDF-VP2: A WIP Implementation of a Physically Plausible (PBR/PBS) HLSL Shader for the Maya Viewport 2.0](https://github.com/hogjonny/Maya-PBR-BRDF-VP2)

In Oct 2016 I accepted a position with Amazon, Lumberyard - Austin, an org within AWS.  

What was Lumberyard, has now become the Open 3D Engine (aka O3DE) https://www.o3de.org/  

I started as a Sr. Technical Artist with additional responsibilities as the 'Product Owner' for a new team focused on environments. I started contributing in many ways, including functional designs for environment components, workflows and documentation, so I was promoted to a Product Manager (Technical).  

I scaled my job to design intricate and entirely new system and component patterns for procedural world design, such as Dynamic Vegetation (procedural biome design and decorative object placement), and Landscape Canvas a node-graph based visual editor for procedural world design (and these patterns and systems are now being extended to the new terrain system. Then I focused on scaling python across the engine for Technical Artists, automated testing, and editor customization and extensibility. Following that I was tasked with being the rendering PM to get Atom usable, integrated into the engine, complete with content workflows, pipelines and tools, and the goal to ship the first version to our customers and the public.  

Design Technology is where the needs of art and technology collide, as a Sr.DT I deep-dive on design, own large parts of our ecosystem, and most importantly act as First Customer ... I use the product like our customers, this is a flywheel that generates unmet customer needs and product improvements.  

I've been working in a game dev related field now for nearly 30 years. My experience covers several tracks across my career; from Intern to Producer. My core background is 3D art and technologies, making games on the cutting edge. I have worked with some of the most influential companies in the industry, including EA, Activision, Atari, Take2/Rockstar and Sony (SCEA).  

I believe the future is platform agnostic gaming experiences and cross-platform play that focus more on the consumer and their identity, then the identity of the device or service we play through. A web of game experiences spread across all the devices in our life. We may take gaming on the go with our tablets and phones, but come home to an extended HD experience in our living room, or cutting edge PC.  

I am a tinkerer at heart, making games fulfills all of my creative desires. During my career, I have directly contributed to the design, art, and development of over 16 titles that have shipped (plus additional platform skews), several canceled or unannounced projects and many demos and showcases.
